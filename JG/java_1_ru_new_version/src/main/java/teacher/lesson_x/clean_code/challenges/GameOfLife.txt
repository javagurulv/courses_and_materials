What is Conway’s Game of Life?

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by
John Horton Conway. A cellular automaton is a collection
of cells on a grid that evolve based on specific steps
relating to the states of neighbouring cells.
The Game of Life is a very popular example of this and only
has four basic rules, that can be further simplified down to
two conditions.

Rule 1 (Underpopulation)
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours will die.

Rule 2 (Survival)
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours will live on.

Rule 3 (Overpopulation)
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours will die.

Rule 4 (Reproduction)
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours, will become a live cell itself.


This can be simplified down to the following pseudocode snippet:

LOOP over all cells:
    IF this cell is alive:
        IF it has less than 2 or more than 3 neighbours:
            This cell is dead
    ELSE:
        IF it has exactly 3 neighbours:
            This cell is alive

This can obviously be even further simplified into a single IF/ELIF,
but I have kept it simple, so it is easier to understand. The one
thing to remember about this program is that each cell has to be
updated at once and not one after the other. This prevents a cell
coming to life or dying and affecting the next cell’s update.


Conclusion

Once the rules for Life have been implemented, the program would be
useless without a way to draw cells. Therefore, there are simple
modifications and extensions that can be made to the script to
add to the functionality:

(SIMPLE) Allow drawing/deleting cells on the grid
(SIMPLE) Allow pausing and playing the automaton
(MODERATE) Allow zooming and panning on a larger grid
(MODERATE) Create presets for patterns to easily insert them
(HARD) Make the grid infinite
